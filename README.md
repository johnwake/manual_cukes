## Manual Cucumber Testing Framework

This is a simple framework for performing manual tests using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info)

This framework allows you to run your feature files and will prompt for your input after each step in all scenarios.

For example:

    Feature: Search for Cheese on Google
        Given I am on the Google search page
            *Is this correct [y|n]*
        When I search for 'Cheese'
            *Is this correct [y|n]*
        Then I should see search results containing 'Cheddar'
            *Is this correct [y|n]*

By default we generate a time stamped report which will appear in the root directory of the project.

- How to run single feature file and tags
- Check it works OK when mixed with automated tests
